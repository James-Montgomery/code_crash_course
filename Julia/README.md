# Julia

## History

Julia is a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language designed for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science. Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. Julia is dynamically-typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use. Julia has high level syntax, making it an accessible language for programmers from any background or experience level.

If you want the performance of C and the ease of use of Python, maybe try Julia! Julia is still a young language, however, and has a smaller community supporting it.
