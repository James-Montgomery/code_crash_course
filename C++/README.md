# C++

## History

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

## Installation

Similarly to C, you very rarely need to install C++ if you are using a modern operating system.

If you don't already have it, you can install the compiler using brew:

```
brew install gcc
```

## HelloWorld

```
g++ ./HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cpp
./a.out
```
