# C

## History

C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix.  It is one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal runtime support.

C provides efficiency, high performance, and high quality softwares, flexibility and power, many high-level and low-level operations like middle level, stability and small size code, provide functionality through rich set of function libraries, and gateway for other professional languages like C, C++, and Java.

## Installation

You don't need to install C. C is an amazingly low-level, powerful language that almost any computer you will ever use leverages.

If you don't already have it, you can install the compiler using brew:

```
brew install gcc
```

## HellowWorld

```
gcc ./HelloWorld/HelloWorld.c
./a.out
```

## Import

```
gcc ./Import/main.c
./a.out
```

## OLS

```
gfortran -c -O3 ./OLS/BLAS-3.8.0/*.f
```
