# Java

## History

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. Java is relatively easy to learn, has a nice object oriented framework, and a broad user base.

It's a nice compromise between the performance of C languages and the ease of use of Python or Julia.
