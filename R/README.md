# R

## History

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. It's a great language for research and proof of concept work. It's popularly used for analysis by statisticians.

# Installation

```
brew install r
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
```

I recommend using conda virtual environments to manage dependancies for R projects. You can find a quick start guid [Here](../Environments/Conda/README.md).

## HelloWorld

```
Rscript ./HelloWorld/HelloWorld.R
```

rscript ./Import/requirements.R
```
