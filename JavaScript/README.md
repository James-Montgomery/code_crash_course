# JavaScript

## History

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

## Installation

I recommend running js code in a browser rather than through the local terminal. However, I include examples of how to run js files locally.

```
brew install node
```

## Using JS in a Browser

If you want to use JS in browser instead of on a local terminal, follow the instructions below.
