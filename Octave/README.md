# Octave

## History

GNU Octave is software featuring a high-level programming language, primarily intended for numerical computations. Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.

Octave is a popular research / prototyping language for mathematicians, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. Many of my favorite data science courses are taught in Octave.
